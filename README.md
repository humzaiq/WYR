##About the Project
"WYR - Would You Rather" is a web-based application developed as part of the Udacity coursework. This interactive game poses "Would you rather" questions, allowing you to choose between two options and then viewing responses from the community. 

####Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
Question Creation: Users can create their own "Would you rather" questions.
Polls: Participate in polls created by other users.
Results Visualization: After voting, users can see the percentage of votes for each option.
Leaderboard: Ranking of users based on their activity in the app.

####How It Works
Upon successful login, users are presented with a list of unanswered questions. Each question has two options. After voting on a question, users can see the poll results. Users can navigate to different sections of the app to create new questions, view answered questions, or check the leaderboard.
